# Intermediate Python Concepts

Welcome to this project! This repository contains **intermediate-level Python code examples and explanations**, perfect for learners looking to strengthen their foundational Python knowledge.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

This project includes practical code examples and clear explanations for the following intermediate Python topics:


- Python Import Module
- Python Functions
- Python String
- Lists, Dictionary, Sets
- Python Class
- Pickling Objects
- Comprehension
- Generator
- Type Hints


## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

By working through the examples in this repo, youâ€™ll learn to:

- Write cleaner, modular, and reusable Python code.
- Use built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets efficiently.
- Handle function arguments with flexibility.
- Use anonymous functions (lambda) in real-world Python applications.
- Pickling is faster than converting objects to text formats like JSON for saving.
- It can handle many Python-specific types, including objects of custom classes.
- Understand and implement **list comprehensions** for transforming and filtering lists in a single line.
- Use **dictionary comprehensions** to create key-value pairs from lists or other iterable data.
- Apply **set comprehensions** to build sets while automatically removing duplicate entries.
- Leverage **conditional logic (`if`) within comprehensions** to filter data on-the-fly.
- Avoid common errors by using the **`get()` method** to safely access dictionary values.
- Understand how to create and use generators using yield and yield from for efficient, lazy data processing.
- Learn to write memory-friendly code and generate values on-the-fly, including infinite data streams and custom iterators.
- Understand how to use type annotations in classes to improve code readability, maintainability, and tooling support.
