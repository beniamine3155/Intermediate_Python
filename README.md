## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

By working through this repository, you will learn to:

- Write **modular, clean, and reusable Python code** using imports and functions.  
- Efficiently manipulate built-in data structures like **lists, dictionaries, and sets**.  
- Handle **function arguments flexibly** and understand Pythonâ€™s scoping rules.  
- Use **lambda expressions** for concise, anonymous function definitions.  
- Work with **higher-order functions** to pass functions as arguments and return them from other functions.  
- Serialize and deserialize Python objects using **pickling** for fast storage and retrieval.  
- Implement **list, dictionary, and set comprehensions** for concise and readable code.  
- Incorporate **conditional logic within comprehensions** to filter and transform data efficiently.  
- Safely access dictionary values using **`get()`** to avoid common errors.  
- Create **memory-efficient generators** using `yield` and `yield from` for lazy evaluation and custom iterators.  
- Write Python code with **type hints** to improve readability, maintainability, and tooling support.  
- Validate and enforce data structures using **Pydantic** for robust Python applications.  
- Utilize **enumerate** to loop through iterables with indices effectively.
